# sdlc-skills — Roadmap

> Durable strategy: sequencing, gating dependencies, milestones, deferred work. Operational state
> (what's building right now) lives in [`dev-state.md`](dev-state.md); the *why* behind a call lives in
> [`adr/`](adr/).

## What this is

This repo owns the **house SDLC** — the three skills (`house-shaper` · `house-orchestrator` ·
`house-builder`) plus the shared docs & hygiene doctrine that every other project of Jake's runs its
development loop through. The next chapter is **house v2**: a state-first kernel (`house` CLI + on-disk
records) that gives the process a machine-readable skeleton, so agents and the coming desktop IDE read the
same truth. See [ADR-0002](adr/0002-house-v2-state-first-redesign.md).

## house v2 program

Shaped 2026-07-28. Spec: [`superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-house-v2-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-house-v2-design.md).
Decision: [ADR-0002](adr/0002-house-v2-state-first-redesign.md). The CLI ships before the skills, and both
ship before the IDE — the contract must be true from a bare terminal on day one.

| # | Slice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Kernel + `house` CLI** — `schema/enums.yaml`, slice-dir scaffold, events.jsonl, `house new/init/event/gate/task/state/status/list/next/validate/index/render`. Dogfooded on this repo. Plan: [`superpowers/plans/2026-07-28-house-v2-s1-kernel-cli.md`](superpowers/plans/2026-07-28-house-v2-s1-kernel-cli.md) | **Planned** — spec approved (owner), plan checked **GO-WITH-FIXES**, all 8 must-fixes + advisories folded |
| S2 | **Skills rewrite + doctrine v2 + hooks** — shaper/orchestrator/builder as thin actors over shared state; canonical stage table, one rigor dial, take/suppress/own composition contract; hooks wired into `.claude/settings.json` | Slated — carries from S1: `blocked_on` / `gate.requested` writers · `tasks.yaml` authoring at handoff · style-attr `url()` refs in the mockup self-containment grep · `install.sh` wiring for the CLI |
| S3 | **Migrate the proving pair** — `house init` + `house adopt` + active-slice adoption on sdlc-skills and edge-scanner | Slated |
| S4+ | **The desktop IDE** — shaped as its own slice against a contract already true on disk (workspace, side pane, webview mockups, approvals inbox, terminal panes); gets its own shaping pass and its own repo | Slated — blocked on S1–S3 |

## Deferred (recorded, not lost)

- **OpenSpec delta-specs / capability truth files** — best template in the corpus, deferred to **v2.1**: a
  large authoring-habit change, and the headline benefit (location-is-status) is bought more cheaply by the
  merge-event projection + `house archive`. Revisit when **≥3 projects have real capability overlap**. The
  slice-dir layout is deliberately forward-compatible.
- **Beads-style daemon / database** — **no.** JSONL + a rebuildable index steals the architecture without the
  machinery; a daemon would break the "`git clone` + a text editor is sufficient" clause.
- **Hill charts replacing checkboxes** — no; one optional `confidence: uphill|over-the-top|downhill` field on
  unit records instead. Evidence-gated ticks remain the ledger.
- **A fourth agent role · ACP as a durable contract · spec→code regeneration (Tessl)** — no.

proposals): [`superpowers/research/2026-07-28-house-v2/`](superpowers/research/2026-07-28-house-v2/).
